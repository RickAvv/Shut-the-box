# Try to Shut the box :)

This code simulates the game [Shut the box](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shut_the_box)

The solo.py script simulates n games played solo, 1v1.py simulates *n* matches of *m* games between two players.
#

- Implement a **strategy** that maximizes the probability of shutting the box, or minimizes the score! (or both, I don't really know how the math works)

- Make 2 strategies **battle each other** to see which one wins more often! 

- Change the **parameters** (score calculation, number of tiles on the board, number of games per match) and see if different variants of the game require different strategies!

## Have Fun!
